# Vending Machine System

A Java-based vending machine implementation demonstrating object-oriented design principles and design patterns.

## Overview

This project simulates a vending machine system that handles product selection, payment processing, inventory management, and change dispensing. It showcases clean code architecture and software design patterns commonly used in enterprise applications.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Support for multiple product types with pricing
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time inventory management and stock validation
- **Payment Processing**: Multiple payment methods (cash, card, digital)
- **Change Dispensing**: Automatic change calculation and coin/bill dispensing
- **State Management**: Proper state handling for different machine operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for edge cases

## Design Patterns Used

- **State Pattern**: Managing different vending machine states (Idle, Selection, Payment, Dispensing)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different payment processing strategies
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating different types of products
- **Observer Pattern**: Notifying about inventory changes
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensuring single instance of vending machine

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (optional, if using Maven build)
